<h1>Issue Time in Status</h1>
<h2>Easily find the time spent in the current status for the issue being viewed</h2>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No need for setup as the information is displayed immediately on the right panel along with standard Jira properties</li>
  <li>If you click over the glance, you can get the time spent on other statuses too</li>
</ul> 
<h3>Few more details</h3>
<p>
The app measures the time each issue has been on a specific Status. The app measures even the previous duration the issue has been on a specific status. For instance, if initially the issue has been for 1 minute in TODO, then you move it to DOING, then you move it again to TODO. After a minute, it will report as 2 minutes spent in TODO status.
</br>By default, the app is installed as a glance that gets displayed in the right side of the issue being viewed. It will show the total time the issue has spent on the current status.
</br>If you click over the glance, it will show the total time the issue has spent in all the different statuses it has been before.
</br>The calculated time is measured in hours.
